            <p class="hi"> I am a graduating senior broadcast journalism and government and politics major. I'm
                from New Jersey and have loved reading and writing ever since I was little.
                I'm the photo editor for University of Maryland’s “UMD Writers Bloc” and worked as a
                writer and guest host on University of Maryland's WMUC “Humpnight”.
                I loves making videos in school and doing multiplatform journalism outside of class.
                I've interned at the Senate and for a freelance journalist.  When I'm not doing
                journalism, I love traveling, hiking and doing landscape photography.
