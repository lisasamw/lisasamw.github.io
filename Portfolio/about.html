        <p> I am a graduating senior broadcast journalism and government and politics major. I'm
            from New Jersey and have loved reading and writing ever since I was little.
            I'm the photo editor for University of Maryland’s “UMD Writers Bloc” and worked as a
            writer and guest host on University of Maryland's WMUC “Humpnight”.
            I loves making videos in school and doing multiplatform journalism outside of class.
            I've interned at the Senate and for a freelance journalist.  When I'm not doing
            journalism, I love traveling, hiking and doing landscape photography.
